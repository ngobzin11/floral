# Language Floral

Floral is proof of concept Java application for a formalized pseudocode to high-level language (JavaScript, PHP and Python) code generator. It has a defined structure like most high level languages, but it uses aliasing to give a programmer the ability to shape the language into their own structure and therefore closely resembling pseudocode. Syntactic error checking is done in floral and semantic error checking is handled by the output language itself. At this stage floral doesn't run the program, so it's easier to think of it as a code generator with an advanced preprocessor and a standard lexer, parser and code generator.

This is a proof of concept college project and it is NOT maintained anymore.
